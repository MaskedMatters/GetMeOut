This mods allows you to easily quit any game/server you are in with a dedicated quit hotkey!

We just released v1.0.0 on August 4th, 2025, it requires Fabric API and Fabric Language Kotlin to run in 1.21.8. We have plans to expand and keep updating as new Minecraft versions are released. We also plan to backtrack from 1.21.8 all the way to 1.11 for now.
