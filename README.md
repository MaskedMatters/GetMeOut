This mod allows you to easily quit any game/server you are in with a dedicated quit hotkey!

We just released v1.0.0 on August 4th, 2025, it requires Fabric API and Fabric Language Kotlin to run in 1.21.8. We have plans to expand and keep updating as new Minecraft versions are released. We also plan to backtrack from 1.21.8 all the way to 1.11 for now.

This is the Quick Disconnect hotkey set to period within the Controls screen:

We now also have toast notifications for when it's safe to leave the game (in Minecraft versions that don't have the saving game screen):

> [!NOTE]
> We are switching to use only Java, instead of Kotlin, to lessen the amount of dependencies and work towards keeping our mod as simple as possible. 
> The Java version of this mod starts with the 2.x.x prefix, this is a Java branch.
